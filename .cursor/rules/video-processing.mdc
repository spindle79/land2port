# Video Processing Patterns

## Video Processor Architecture
- Use trait-based design with `VideoProcessor` trait for different processing strategies
- Implement specialized processors for different object types (e.g., `BallVideoProcessor`)
- Use composition to combine different smoothing strategies
- Maintain state in processor structs for frame-to-frame consistency

## YOLO Model Integration
- Use `usls` library for YOLO model loading and inference
- Support multiple model versions (v6, v8, v10, v11) and scales (n, s, m, l)
- Handle different object types with appropriate model selection
- Use proper error handling for model loading failures

## Crop Calculation Patterns
- Implement sophisticated crop logic based on object count and positioning
- Support stacked crops for multiple objects
- Use percentage-based similarity thresholds for crop smoothing
- Handle edge cases (0 objects, 1 object, 2+ objects) with appropriate fallbacks

## Performance Considerations
- Process frames in batches when possible
- Use appropriate data types (fp16, fp32) based on hardware
- Support multiple backends (CPU, CUDA, CoreML)
- Implement cut detection to optimize processing

## State Management
- Maintain previous crop information for smoothing
- Track object detection history for prediction
- Use cut detection to reset state when appropriate
- Handle frame-to-frame consistency properly
